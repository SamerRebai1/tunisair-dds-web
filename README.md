✈️ DDS Web Application – Defect & Deferment System
📌 Project Overview

The DDS Web Application (Defect & Deferment System) is a web-based platform developed during my internship to manage aircraft defects and operational limitations in a structured, secure, and efficient way.

The application centralizes defect tracking, limitation management, audit logging, and data export, replacing manual or spreadsheet-based processes with a modern web solution.
